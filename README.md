I tried to reproduce the issue using vanilla JavaScript SDK. Actually, here Firebase AppCheck with reCAPTCHA provider works as expected: requests originated from authentic apps do get accepted, while requests from inauthentic resources don't. So, it seems that indeed the FlutterWeb layer causes the issue.
